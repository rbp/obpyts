Obfuscated Python T-Shirt
==========================

This is just some play code I originally wrote for the Python Brasil at Campus Party in 2009 (I think).

This is not meant as an example of how to write Python. Quite the contrary.


FILES
======

* tshirt.py - the original code
* tshirt2012 - code for PythonBrasil[8]
* README.md - this file


FIXME
======

* Reduce first and last line to 83 columns (same as the widest logo line)

* Some of the marker characters stand out (such as Ã¸ among o's and d's).


TODO
=====

* Another possible "algorithm" (suggested by @mishok13): reduce strings of contiguous
  equal characters, and encode those.
